Hi, I’m Dawn Gregory

I have several projects developed over the years that will eventually get posted here.
- BlogFlutter - a Wordpress plugin that tweets for you https://github.com/dawngregory/blogflutter
- FoodWords - Nutrition database and Python notebooks for key analysis

I’m currently learning Python for Data Science, analyzing nutrient profiles pulled from the USDA database
